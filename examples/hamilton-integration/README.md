This examples shows the "2-layer" approach to building RAG and LLM agents using Burr and Hamilton.

You will find:

- `notebook.ipynb` contains a guide on how to build a modular RAG application. It details how a typicaly project evolves and how Burr and Hamilton can help you achieve the desired modularity.
- `application.py` and `actions/` contain the code from the final application version showed in the notebook.
